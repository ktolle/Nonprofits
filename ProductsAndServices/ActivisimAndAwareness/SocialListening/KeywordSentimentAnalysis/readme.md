The Keyword sentiment analysis solution accelerator for nonprofits is based on an AppSource solution developed by the PowerBI team. With permission we have this application and made it easier for users to modify the cognitive pipeline after installation.  

This solution was made production quality by doing "built-with" development with Microsoft partner Jump Start Ninja (http://jumpstartninja.com). They have added the following features to enable nonprofits (and other users) to customize the pipeline in the following ways:
* Change the keywords being monitored from the News and Twitter
* Control costs by selecting the limits for the search
* Choose languages that are monitored

Soon to be released features are:
* "Deploy to Azure" button will take away the steps requrired to configure the solution
